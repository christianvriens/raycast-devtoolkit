# v2.1.0 â€” 2025-10-02

This release includes UI fixes and developer tooling improvements:

- Fix Raycast result field updates so repeated actions (format/minify/escape) update the result pane correctly.
- Add smoke test script to verify Python CLI integration.
- Remove hard-coded absolute paths from TypeScript and VS Code settings; use workspace-relative paths.
- Update documentation to prefer `defaultValue` for Raycast Form result fields and recommend id/key remount pattern when needed.
- Changelog and release notes added.
