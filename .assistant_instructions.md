Project policy for automated assistants

- Always run the full test-suite before creating any commit that changes source code.
- Use the project launcher to run tests: `./python-tools/run.sh test` so tests run in an isolated venv.
- If tests fail, do not commit; report failures and open an issue or fix before retrying.
